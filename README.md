# Microservices
Investigating the lifecycle of Microservices

# History
I started this project after seeing all the fuss about microservices, especially the spring boot microservice framework. The place I work in have developers who have a Phd degree and now they code in Java Spring boot. A part of me always wanted to prove that simple things do work better than complex airy things.This prompted me to use python and REST to build a scalable, robust microservice.This is a work in progress and this is the first time I am creating a microservice of my own. The purpose of this project is to learn from scratch.

# Technical Stuff
The project has the following dependencies:
Python 2.7,

Cassandra 3.10,

Django Framework 1.11.16,

Django REST Framework 3.8.2,

django-cassandra-engine 1.5.4

# Pledge
I shall comment all the vital sections of my code so that all the newbies (like me) can understand it without the aid of any tutorial.

I shall continue enhancing this project,so that everyone can use it independent of platform.

I shall make this project scalable and robust.

**Controversial** I shall continue to hate JAVA and promote PYTHON.
